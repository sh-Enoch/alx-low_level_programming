linked lists
stores data as nodes.the data is linked to each other through pointers so each node points to another node.
the head pointer points to the first element in the list.
thi helps to access the whiole list.
pointers help us access and change the elements in our list.
doubly linked list has a pointer to the previous and a pointer to the next. thus help us traverse the list in a two way.
